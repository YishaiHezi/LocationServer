Current status:

Where am I now:
I want to upload the server app to aws.
Currently I'm trying to understand all the different components in my application, to know
How can I upload it to aws.

For example, regarding the DB, instead of using a local instance of DynamoDB,
I need to use the DynamoDB service provided by AWS.

Also, need to fix the following:

- Currently all the flow (user 1 ask for user 2 location) should work. but it doesn't work good, because
  I do Thread.sleep() and stuff like that. I need to make it much less expensive. I do Thread.sleep, so it can block the api
  in case there are a lot of requests.

- Need to make the text search (of users whose name starts with prefix) not case sensitive.
