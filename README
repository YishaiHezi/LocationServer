Currently this application runs only locally. So in order to run it,
you need to do the following steps:


1. Clone the project from github.
2. Open the application in intellij, and place the firebase-service-account.json under the resources folder
   (next to application.yaml file). The firebase-service-account.json file is located now in my drive,
   next to the other passwords.
3. Have a docker in your local computer.
4. Run the database in the docker:
   open terminal, and run the following command: "docker compose up"
5. Run the application from intellij.
